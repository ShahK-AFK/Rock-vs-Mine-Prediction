# Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction
A machine learning project to classify sonar signals as either a rock or a mine.

### Project Overview
This project uses machine learning to classify sonar signals reflected from an object as either a rock or a mine. The goal is to build a robust model that can accurately distinguish between the two based on the signal patterns.

### Methodology
1.  **Data Loading & Preprocessing:** The dataset was loaded using `pandas` and a brief exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed.
2.  **Model Training:** A Logistic Regression model from `scikit-learn` was trained on the data.
3.  **Evaluation:** The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy score.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn:** For model building and evaluation.

### Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 76% on the test data.

### How to Run
To run this project, simply download the `.ipynb` file and the `sonar data.csv` file. You can open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab and run the cells.
